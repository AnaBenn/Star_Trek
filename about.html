				<p>Star Trek: The Next Generation (abbreviated as TNG and ST:TNG) is an American science-fiction television series in the Star Trek franchise created by Gene Roddenberry that ran from 1987 to 1994.</p>
				<p>The series follows the adventures of a space-faring crew on board the Galaxy Class starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D). The series is set about 70 years after the final mission of the original Enterprise crew under the command of James T. Kirk. The Federation has undergone significant internal changes in its quest to explore and seek out new life, adding new degrees of complexity and controversy to its methods, especially those focused on the Prime Directive. The Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets have ceased wartime hostilities and become galactic allies, while more sinister foes such as the Romulans and the Borg take precedence on the series.</p>
				<p>The Enterprise is commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard and is staffed by first officer Commander William Riker, second officer/operations manager Data, security chief Tasha Yar, ship's counselor Deanna Troi, chief medical officer Dr. Beverly Crusher and her son Wesley Crusher, conn officer Lieutenant Geordi La Forge, and junior officer Lieutenant Worf. The death of Lieutenant Yar in the twenty-third episode of the first season (1987-1988) of the series prompts an internal shuffle of personnel, making Worf official chief of security. In season two, La Forge is promoted to chief engineer and Katherine Pulaski briefly takes over for Beverly Crusher.</p>

					<h3>Why Next Generation Endures</h3>
					<p>Star Trek stories are humanistic; they are founded in Gene Roddenberry’s belief in the perfectible human. They provide an optimistic vision of our future. Star Trek tells us that no matter how crazy the world may look today, it will get better. We will get better. There will be a time in which doing great things will be the norm.</p>
					<p>Star Trek depicts a meritocracy. The characters were cool not because of looks, wealth, or social position, but because they were very good at their jobs. It is a rare television show that sends the message that it is cool to be smart.</p>
					<p>Star Trek’s “Wagon Train to the stars” construct meant that each episode found the crew in a new place. Each new world enabled the writers to imagine new scenarios to challenge the crew of the Enterprise. The veil of new species and new civilizations allowed the writers to tell issues stories and create moral plays that probed our contemporary views without overtly criticizing them.</p>
